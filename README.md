This code was written for a school project in 2021. This webservice offers a website with a simple, self-created permissioning system with user accounts.
**This software should NOT be used in production as it contains many major security risks.**

## Run this project
To run this project a valid installation of NodeJS is required. If node is installed execute following terminal commands inside the root directory:

`npm install`

Installing all dependencies required to run this project.

`node server.js`

Start the webservice, which logs into the console on which local port the system will be available.

## Scope of this project

The idea behind this project was to try an own approach to user verification systems to get a deeper understanding of it. That also is the reason why
this project should not be used in a production environment: When creating this project I did not focus on resolving security vulnerabilities. After all
it is just a practice project.
